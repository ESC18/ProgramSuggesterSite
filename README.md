## Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* GIT
* JS
* Chrome & Firefox Web developer tools

## Description of Application:
This web application is a small survey site which can be used as a tool to determine a proper coding language for you to use or learn! It takes in values to determine your current skillset, whether you want a back or front end language, and other various selections. Upon submitting your response - it will provide both text and image based feedback informing you which language it chose for you. The 3 different languages possible to chosen are Swift, Python, and Javascript.

## Setup and installation requirements/guide:
1. First download the repository _"ProgrammingSuggesterSite"_ to your device.
2. Proceed to navigate to the highest level of your directory.
3. Open index.html.

## Known Bugs:
* Site is not fully responsive and will only function for screens 1700 px wide. For Results - use a monitor with a 1080x1920 resolution.
* Ocassionally depending on the selection - there may be ties in 'scores' for two or more of the langauges, this will cause there to be an error message displayed instead of a language result, you can fix this by changing your past selection slightly. The most common two languages to get mixed up are Javascript and Python.
